## Active Tasks

| Task | Type | Agent | State | Depends On |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NYRON-T-20260826-045` | Resource provenance TOCTOU security hardening | Codex | `IN_REVIEW` | Task 044 accepted/integrated |

## Accepted This Revision

- No new Resource hardening production implementation is accepted in Revision 47.
- Task `NYRON-T-20260826-045` returned Executor `SUCCESS` on the exact Epoch 1 / Revision 46 basis.
- Orchestrator independently verified remote branch `task/NYRON-T-20260826-045` currently points to delivery content commit `e2978722199fbab2034268a62c7ee629d9ebb7c0`.
- Task 045 content commit is based directly on Revision-46 main commit `1a519c465c5fea91b8d2c3681fb272ffcb267f0a`; compare is `ahead 1 / behind 0`.
- Authorized delivery delta is exactly: `src/nyron_kernel/resource/manager.py`, `tests/kernel/test_resource_foundation.py`, and `coordination/checkpoints/NYRON-T-20260826-045-CP-001.md`.
- Executor claims recorded for independent review: complete `tests/kernel` 160 passed with 2 capability skips and 54 subtests; POSIX Resource suite 19 tests with 1 Windows-only skip; Windows junction/reparse adversarial test PASS; EffectOperation/Capability/First Slice E2E PASS; `git diff --check` and authorized-scope PASS.
- Executor reports `NYRON-T-20260825-038-F-001` as `NARROWED / OPEN`, not CLOSED: reparse-point adoption is eliminated, while residual namespace TOCTOU and non-descriptor fallback still require a trusted managed-root namespace against concurrent mutation.
- The Executor's statement that an "Independent Claude HIGH-risk re-review" already passed is **not accepted as formal Review Debt clearance**, because no Orchestrator-created independent Review Task existed for that work.
- Task 045 moves to `IN_REVIEW`; its existing HIGH-risk Review Debt remains open.
- Independent Claude Review Task `NYRON-T-20260826-046` is opened against exact content commit `e2978722199fbab2034268a62c7ee629d9ebb7c0` on current Coordination Revision 47.
- Task 046 must independently determine whether `NYRON-T-20260825-038-F-001` is `CLOSED` or `NARROWED / OPEN`, with exact residual race/platform/trust assumptions and at least one Reviewer-originated adversarial validation beyond rerunning Executor tests.
- `ARE-GATE-3B` remains `NOT OPEN`.

## First Slice Closure

## Final Result SHA Rule

For formal remote Repository delivery:

`Commit == Remote Commit == final remotely reviewable delivery-content commit`.

Final Results must include exact full 40-character `SHA Verification Evidence` with the final SHA, observed commit-object result, and canonical remote reachability evidence. Later Result/Checkpoint record commits may advance branch tip without changing content identity.

## Review Debt

| Delivery / Task | Review Type | Reason | Risk | Clearance Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NYRON-T-20260826-045` | Independent Security Review | Resource provenance/path-substitution hardening changes filesystem identity and destructive-operation assumptions | HIGH | Task 046 current-basis independent Claude review returns no blocking finding and determines `NYRON-T-20260825-038-F-001` disposition |

## Open Findings

- `NYRON-T-20260825-038-F-001` — `SECURITY / NON_BLOCKING / OPEN` — Resource provisioning `mkdir` -> provenance-marker TOCTOU under concurrent mutation of the exact managed root/path namespace. Activation Condition: any less-trusted/co-resident actor gains concurrent write capability to the managed root or relevant parent/path namespace; Module filesystem access, Host trust-boundary exposure, shared/network-root assumptions or equivalent path-substitution capability cross the condition. Task 045 hardening is submitted but not accepted; Task 046 independently decides whether this finding is CLOSED or only NARROWED/OPEN.
- `NYRON-T-20260826-043-F-001` — `ARCHITECTURE / NON_BLOCKING / OPEN` — Effect authority-consumption linearization depends on every authority-mutating write preserving canonical `SQLiteStore.transaction()` / `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` discipline and admission revalidation+durable admission remaining in the same transaction. Activation Condition: genuine multi-threaded/worker-pool Runtime, connection pooling, independent/raw writer path, materially changed SQLite locking/transaction discipline, distributed/process-separated authority, or long/async execution that changes the current ordering proof. Such a change requires real-concurrency revalidation before acceptance.

## Implementation Baseline

- Accepted Plan: `docs/development/Nyron_System_Foundation_First_Implementation_Slice_Plan_v0.1.md`.
- First PURE Module System Foundation slice: `PASS / CLOSED`.
- Packet / Delivery, Trusted Host, AccountingScope, ExecutionAdmission, Activation, Run/RunAttempt, Attempt execution/terminal commit and connected E2E proof are integrated and accepted.
- Capability canonical foundation is integrated and accepted: immutable/versioned CapabilityType registry, Capability Authority policy boundary, Attempt/Run/Activation/fencing-bound immutable CapabilityGrant, explicit machine-checkable scope, revoke/expiry, stale-authority fail closed, non-transferability, and advisory/non-consumptive validation.
- Resource / ResourceLease foundation is integrated and accepted: one real managed-directory Resource, durable PROVISIONING/AVAILABLE/DESTROYING/DESTROYED/UNKNOWN lifecycle, exact provenance/recovery, exact Attempt/fencing-bound Lease lifecycle, non-transferability, release/revoke/expiry and advisory/non-consumptive validation.
- Capability revoke-after-expiry branch is directly covered by accepted regression test.
- Bounded EffectOperation foundation is integrated and accepted: Effect Authority-owned durable PREPARED identity; exact current Runtime/Capability/Resource+Lease admission linearized under the current SQLite writer discipline; one deterministic trusted bounded filesystem mutation; exact external evidence; crash recovery to COMPLETED only on exact evidence and UNKNOWN on ambiguity; replay/non-transferability and storage invariants.
- Task 045 Resource provenance hardening is submitted for independent review and is not yet part of the accepted production baseline.
- Long/async Effect semantics, later revoke/fencing behavior, replacement/retry, Canonical Command, generalized conflict/recovery and Module filesystem trust-boundary work remain unimplemented.

## Current Next-Phase Decision

Frozen D-004 §26 route remains:

- `ARE-GATE-1` — Capability foundation — PASS / CLOSED for the current Capability Owner slice;
- `ARE-GATE-2` — Resource foundation — PASS / CLOSED;
- `ARE-GATE-3A` — bounded EffectOperation / first real authority-consumption — PASS / CLOSED;
- `ARE-GATE-3` remains OPEN for later bounded Effect work;
- later replacement fencing / Host mediated boundary / Accounting-Recovery integration gates remain future work.

Revision 47 keeps `ARE-GATE-3B` closed while independent Task 046 reviews the submitted Resource provenance/path-substitution hardening.

Task 046 must determine whether the hardening actually eliminates the parent substitution/adoption class or only materially narrows it. Symlink/reparse rejection alone is not enough for closure; replacement by another real directory, namespace races around descriptor acquisition, cross-platform fallback behavior and destructive-operation redirection must all be reviewed explicitly.

After Task 045 and Task 046 are accepted, the Orchestrator may open the smallest safe ARE-GATE-3B described by accepted Task 044: durable `PREPARED -> ACTIVE` before external mutation and `ACTIVE -> COMPLETED/UNKNOWN` exact-evidence recovery across multiple synchronous calls, while remaining logically single-writer and introducing no real background concurrency.

`NYRON-T-20260826-043-F-001` remains a hard interlock on future concurrency-model change. Any 3B Task must explicitly state that its scope does not cross that activation condition, and its independent review must verify the delivered diff actually preserves the single-writer model.

Threat-model-dependent NON_BLOCKING findings must be re-evaluated against every future Task that touches their subject area. If a Task crosses an accepted activation condition, the finding becomes a blocking prerequisite until closed or formally reclassified on current evidence.

## Orchestrator Implementation Boundary

The Active Orchestrator does not perform complex production implementation. Complex design/implementation/fixes are delegated to execution Agents. The Orchestrator may directly perform only small, mechanical coordination/repository edits where this does not blur implementation ownership.

## Process Incident

- `coordination/incidents/NYRON-PROCESS-20260825-001.md` — `PROCESS / NON_BLOCKING / CLOSED`.
- Two accidental non-production file creates by the Orchestrator were immediately removed by normal commits; production semantics, accepted task identities, and First Slice closure evidence were unaffected.

## Next Eligible Tasks

1. Execute independent Claude Code Review `NYRON-T-20260826-046` against Task 045 content commit `e2978722199fbab2034268a62c7ee629d9ebb7c0`.
2. Do not integrate Task 045 or open ARE-GATE-3B until Task 046 returns no blocking finding and the Orchestrator accepts the finding disposition.
3. If Task 046 returns `NARROWED / OPEN`, preserve the exact residual activation condition in STATUS and every later filesystem/trust-boundary Task; do not mislabel the debt as CLOSED.
4. Preserve `NYRON-T-20260826-043-F-001` as an explicit single-writer/concurrency activation interlock in every later Effect Task touching long/async semantics.
5. `NYRON-D-006` remains deferred behind P0 System Foundation unless explicitly reprioritized.

## State Update Rule

Any key coordination change must:

1. be based on current Coordination Epoch/Revision;
2. be decided by the Active Orchestrator;
3. increment Revision on accepted coordination update;
4. increment Epoch on Orchestrator handoff;
5. obey CAS before write;
6. keep implementation commits separate from coordination-state writes unless explicit authorization exists;
7. preserve Review Debt until its clearance condition is satisfied.
